##  Create a new user in your PostgreSQL

1. Connect to the PostgreSQL database using the psql command-line tool:

$ sudo -u postgres psql

2. In the psql prompt, create a new user with the desired username, replacing <username> with the name you want to use:

postgres=# CREATE USER <username>;

3. Set a password for the new user:

postgres=# ALTER USER <username> WITH PASSWORD '<password>';

Replace <password> with a strong, secure password (remember that the password must be in ' ').

4. Exit psql by typing \q and pressing Enter.

After creating the new user and granting it the necessary permissions, 
you should be able to connect to the PostgreSQL database using the new username and password or by peer. 
Make sure to update your Python code to use the correct username and password.

##  Granting permision to user to create a database:

While in the postgreSQL prompt, type:

ALTER USER bftormin CREATEDB;

Sequentially, in terminal should be:

sudo -u postgres createdb my_db
